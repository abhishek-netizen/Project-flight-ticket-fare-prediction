Insight:
We just cant say hotel cancellation is more in domestic compared to international, Coz we have less records in International compared to domestic.
& Air cancellation, air loss and Air, are independent of each other, i can say this because its not like 19-04-2018 22:22 Netfare is x amount and air cancelation for same flight same date & time cancelattion  fee is x amount, No such records for perticular flight periculardate of booking,Cancellation,loss can be seen in the data.
we dont no cancellation fare is for the same flight or not. what i think is its not.

so 
lets filter only AIR class from ProductType.
*DOM -ve to +ve AIR productType-count:6206
*INT -ve to +ve AIR productType-count:354

after converting -ve values of Domesric and International to +ve
I Standardized the Netfare, and fetched for outliers.. 
after this step i removed the outliers and tried to take average Netfares.
